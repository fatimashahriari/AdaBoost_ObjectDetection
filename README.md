# Project Instructions

To use this project, follow these steps in order:

1. **Build the Weak Learners**: Open and run `WeakLearners.ipynb` first. This notebook sets up the individual weak learner models youâ€™ll need.
2. **Apply AdaBoost**: After the weak learners are ready, run `AdaBoost.ipynb`. It uses the AdaBoost algorithm to combine those models for better results.

**Quick Tip**: Make sure you have Jupyter installed, along with libraries like PyTorch (check the notebooks for details). If you run into setup issues, each notebook might have some notes to help.
